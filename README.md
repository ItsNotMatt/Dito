# Dito
Dito is a CLI tool to create todo items and append them to a list. This can be initialized in any project directory you are working in.

Commands: Dito add "(whatever you want to call it)"
          Dito remove id (number representing the id of the item you want to remove)
          Dito show  |  Optionally add -c to show complete or -i to show incomplete only
          Dito complete id (number representing the id of the item you want to set to complete)

Dito was created to organize todo items or ideas in a clear concise fashion.
Instead of leaving a comment in your code for something that needs to be done or jotting down your idea somewhere else, you can just add it to Dito.
Other organizing applications arent needed so you dont have to switch tabs or services during a programming session.
